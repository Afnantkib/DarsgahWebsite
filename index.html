            اِقۡرَاۡ بِاسۡمِ رَبِّكَ الَّذِىۡ خَلَقَ​ۚ‏

        (96:1) Recite in the name of your Lord Who created
        <ul>
            <li>1. As we have explained in the Introduction, when the Angel said to the Prophet (peace be upon him): Read,
                the latter replied: I cannot read! This indicates that the Angel had presented these words of the revelation
            before him in the written form and had asked him to read them. For if the Angel had meant that he should
            repeat what he recited, he should not have replied, saying: I cannot read!
        </li>
        <li>2. Read in the name of your Lord: Say Bismillah and read. This shows that the Prophet (peace be upon him)
            even before the coming down of this revelation regarded and acknowledged Allah alone as his Lord. That is
            why there was no need to ask who his Lord was, but it was said: Read in the name of your Lord.
        </li>
        <li>
            3. Only the word khalaqa (created) has been used absolutely, and the object of creation has not been
            mentioned. This automatically gives the meaning: Read in the name of the Lord, Who is the Creator, Who
            created the whole universe and everything in it.
        </li>
    </ul>
